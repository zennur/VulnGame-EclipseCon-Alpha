# What is VulnGame?

VulnGame is a project allowing developers to learn how to report vulnerabilities,
discuss with security researchers, and handle security fixes.

# VulnGame Universe

VulnGame is programming-language agnostic! But beware... it requires correct English.

You have just become a maintainer of this project. Previous maintainers moved to
other projects and are not available anymore. Before leaving, they have left
two releases: 0.1 and 0.2. You are on the road to 0.3.

# Rules

A security vulnerability in VulnGame is:
- a spelling mistake in English (both American and British variants are considered
  correct)
- a line length of more than 87 characters (Linux/Unix line breaks), except for links
